# Unofficial GE Proton deb package

The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to install or update [GE Proton](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) with a deb package for Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint.

## Features

- One package per major version, each new minor version overwrites the previous one.
- All games using the same major version are automatically updated to the latest minor version.
- The update is done automatically.

## Installation

- Download the latest deb package from the [releases](https://github.com/peshkopy/ge-proton-deb-package/releases) page.
- Stop Steam.
- Run ```sudo dpkg --install ge-proton-<full-version>_all.deb```
- Start Steam.
- Read the [GE Proton](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) project page for use.

## Update

- The update takes place at the same time as the other system packages.


## Removing

- Stop Steam.
- Run ```sudo dpkg --remove ge-proton-<major-version>```
- Start Steam.

## Notes

- In order to keep the project light, only modified GE Proton file (compatibilitytool.vdf) is versioned.
- Other GE Proton installs are not affected by the deb package.
- GE Proton is installed in the global directory ```/usr/share/steam/compatibilitytools.d/```
- [gitlab.com/peshkopy/debian-package-repo](https://gitlab.com/peshkopy/debian-package-repo) is the package repository.
